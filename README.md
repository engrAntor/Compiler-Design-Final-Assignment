Goal:
This C++ program analyzes a source code file provided as input, separates each token, and categorizes them into different types. The output displays each token along with its respective type.

Description:
The program serves as a lexer, which is a fundamental component in the compilation process of programming languages. It breaks down the source code into individual tokens and identifies their types. Tokens include keywords, identifiers, literals (integers, floats, strings), operators, delimiters, comments, and whitespace.
